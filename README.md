Description
The "Vehicle Signboard Detection and Caution" project is designed to enhance road safety by automatically detecting traffic signboards using computer vision techniques. The system alerts the driver or the vehicle's autonomous control system about the presence of important signboards, such as speed limits, stop signs, or pedestrian crossings, enabling prompt actions that reduce the risk of accidents.

This project combines the power of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with real-time image processing to identify and classify traffic signs from video feeds or images captured by a vehicle-mounted camera. The detection system can be integrated into Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) or autonomous vehicles to improve situational awareness and decision-making on the road.
Data Overview
The dataset consists of various classes of traffic signs, such as speed limits, stop signs, no entry, and pedestrian crossings. Each image is labeled with its corresponding class, which is used for training the detection model.

Implementation
Data Preprocessing
Image Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, scaling, and brightness adjustment are applied to enhance the dataset and improve model robustness.
Normalization: Image pixel values are normalized to enhance model training efficiency.
Model Architecture
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed for feature extraction and classification. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and fully connected layers. The model is trained using labeled signboard images to learn to detect and classify various traffic signs.

Training and Evaluation
Training: The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset with techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize performance.
Evaluation: The model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated on a test dataset. Confusion matrices are generated to visualize classification performance.
Real-Time Detection
Video Processing: Frames from the video feed are captured and processed in real-time.
Signboard Detection: Detected signboards are highlighted, and the corresponding caution message is generated.
Alerts: Visual and/or audio alerts are triggered to notify the driver or vehicle system.
Results and Analysis
Model Accuracy: The trained model achieved high accuracy in detecting and classifying traffic signs.
Real-Time Performance: The system effectively detects signboards in real-time scenarios with minimal latency.
Use Case: The detection system can be integrated into vehicle navigation systems for enhanced road safety.
Conclusion
The "Vehicle Signboard Detection and Caution" system is a crucial component of modern intelligent transportation systems. By accurately detecting traffic signs and providing timely warnings, this system contributes to safer driving environments and reduced accident risks.
